                    <p class="FAQ-text">
                        Folds and creases can be remedied by simply placing something heavy (but safe) like a stack of books on the affected area.
                        After a few days you should notice an improvement and the rug will lay flat on the floor. Creases on a rug will gradually
                        disappear with regular use.

                        There are a number of ways to get rid of stains depending on what kind of stain it is. For best results it’s best to deal
                        with the stain immediately and remove as much of it as you can.

                        We strongly advise you to contact a professional rug cleaner who knows how to properly clean your rug. Attempting to wash your rug
                        yourself can cause irreversible damage to your rug.
